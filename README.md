# Conky Grey
This is my take on the conky grey theme originally from [Hardball](https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/?content=137272_)

Additionally, I was somewhat inspired from [this repo](https://github.com/Archenoth/Conky-Grey-Modified) by [Archenoth](https://github.com/Archenoth). 

Lastly, **this has been setup for use with a 4K monitor**. 

## Installation

1. Install conky
```sudo apt-get install conky-all```
2. Run conky
```conky -c conkyrc_grey```

## Note 1

I have it setup to monitor the usage of a particular directory on my machine. You can view and modify this on line 78 of conkyrc_grey

## Note 2

I left the original license that was being used at [this repo](https://github.com/Archenoth/Conky-Grey-Modified) by [Archenoth](https://github.com/Archenoth).
